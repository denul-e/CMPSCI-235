forward Algorithm: This algorithm advances the current number by one, wrapping around when the maximum value is reached.

Flowchart:

    Start
    Check if current_number is less than MAX_NUMBER
        Yes: Return current_number + 1
        No: Return MIN_NUMBER
    End

Pseudo Code:

function forward(current_number):
    if current_number < MAX_NUMBER:
        return current_number + 1
    else:
        return MIN_NUMBER

backward Algorithm: This algorithm moves the current number backward by one, but stops at the minimum value.

Flowchart:

    Start
    Check if current_number is greater than MIN_NUMBER
        Yes: Return current_number - 1
        No: Return MIN_NUMBER
    End

Pseudo Code:

function backward(current_number):
    if current_number > MIN_NUMBER:
        return current_number - 1
    else:
        return MIN_NUMBER

createFileName Algorithm: This algorithm builds and returns a string that represents a file name based on the given number.

Flowchart:

    Start
    Concatenate the string "picture" with the number and ".gif"
    Return the resulting string
    End

Pseudo Code:

function createFileName(current_number):
    return "picture" + current_number + ".gif"
